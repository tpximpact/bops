      Preparation of this accessibility statement
    </h2>

    <p>
      This statement was prepared on 24th June 2025. This website was last tested on
      1st February 2024. The test was carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
    </p>

    <p>
      We used this approach to deciding on a sample of pages to test two journeys,
      one covering the responding to requests for changes to a planning application
      and another relating to finding and viewing information about how to correctly
      prepare plans and drawings.
