Every formal application is subject to a statutory assessment process and it is only then that a full assessment of all the material planning considerations can be made in the context of relevant development plan policies.\nSome important considerations may only arise or become apparent during this formal process which includes consultation with residents and other third parties affected by the development. This officer advice is therefore given for your general guidance in the preparation of a future planning application or proposal. The advice does not prejudice the Council’s consideration or decision on any future application that may be submitted. \n"
