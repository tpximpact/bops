        The site will be investigated to establish the facts surrounding your enquiry.
        Where a breach is established those responsible will be informed and remedial
        actions requested within a given time-scale. You will be informed within %{days}

        All complaints relating to alleged breaches of planning control will be investigated
        and treated confidentially within the council so far as practicable.
