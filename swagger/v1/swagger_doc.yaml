                            Local planning authorities are responsible for designating conservation areas, though [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) and the Secretary of State also have powers to create them.

                            This dataset also contains the boundaries of conservation areas from Historic England, as well as other data found on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=conservation+area) and currently contains a number of duplicate areas we are working to remove.

                            We are also [working with a group of local planning authorities](/about/) to help them publish their conservation areas, and to develop a [data specification for conservation areas](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/conservation-area).

                            Historic England provide [guidance](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/your-home/owning-historic-property/conservation-area/) to help householders understand the implications of living in a conservation area for planning applications.

                            A Tree Preservation Order (TPO) can be placed on single trees, groups of trees and even whole woodlands. Tree Preservation Orders are made by local planning authorities following [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-preservation-orders-and-trees-in-conservation-areas) provided by the [Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities).

                            Each [tree preservation order](/dataset/tree-preservation-order) may apply to a number of tree preservation order zones, and a number of individual [trees](/dataset/tree).

                            This dataset contains data from [a small group of local planning authorities](/about/) who we are working with to develop a [data specification for tree preservation orders](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/tree-preservation-order).

                            Local planning authorities are responsible for designating conservation areas, though [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) and the Secretary of State also have powers to create them.

                            This dataset also contains the boundaries of conservation areas from Historic England, as well as other data found on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=conservation+area) and currently contains a number of duplicate areas we are working to remove.

                            We are also [working with a group of local planning authorities](/about/) to help them publish their conservation areas, and to develop a [data specification for conservation areas](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/conservation-area).

                            Historic England provide [guidance](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/your-home/owning-historic-property/conservation-area/) to help householders understand the implications of living in a conservation area for planning applications.

                            A Tree Preservation Order (TPO) can be placed on single trees, groups of trees and even whole woodlands. Tree Preservation Orders are made by local planning authorities following [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-preservation-orders-and-trees-in-conservation-areas) provided by the [Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities).

                            Each [tree preservation order](/dataset/tree-preservation-order) may apply to a number of tree preservation order zones, and a number of individual [trees](/dataset/tree).

                            Local planning authorities are responsible for designating conservation areas, though [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) and the Secretary of State also have powers to create them.

                            This dataset also contains the boundaries of conservation areas from Historic England, as well as other data found on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=conservation+area) and currently contains a number of duplicate areas we are working to remove.

                            We are also [working with a group of local planning authorities](/about/) to help them publish their conservation areas, and to develop a [data specification for conservation areas](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/conservation-area).

                            Historic England provide [guidance](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/your-home/owning-historic-property/conservation-area/) to help householders understand the implications of living in a conservation area for planning applications.

                            A Tree Preservation Order (TPO) can be placed on single trees, groups of trees and even whole woodlands. Tree Preservation Orders are made by local planning authorities following [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-preservation-orders-and-trees-in-conservation-areas) provided by the [Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities).

                            Each [tree preservation order](/dataset/tree-preservation-order) may apply to a number of tree preservation order zones, and a number of individual [trees](/dataset/tree).

                            This dataset contains data from [a small group of local planning authorities](/about/) who we are working with to develop a [data specification for tree preservation orders](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/tree-preservation-order).

                            Local planning authorities are responsible for designating conservation areas, though [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) and the Secretary of State also have powers to create them.

                            This dataset also contains the boundaries of conservation areas from Historic England, as well as other data found on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=conservation+area) and currently contains a number of duplicate areas we are working to remove.

                            We are also [working with a group of local planning authorities](/about/) to help them publish their conservation areas, and to develop a [data specification for conservation areas](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/conservation-area).

                            Historic England provide [guidance](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/your-home/owning-historic-property/conservation-area/) to help householders understand the implications of living in a conservation area for planning applications.
